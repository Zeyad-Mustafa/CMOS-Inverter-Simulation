# CMOS Inverter Simulation

This project simulates the voltage transfer characteristic (VTC) of a basic CMOS inverter using Python.

## How to Run
1. Install requirements: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
2. Run the simulation: `python cmos_inverter.py`

## Description
The CMOS inverter is a fundamental component in digital logic. This simulation provides a basic illustration of its behavior.
